    <p class="Content"><span class="title">Red Earth</span>, released in Japan as War-Zard is a fantasy sword and sorcery-themed 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1996. It was the first game for Capcom's CP System III hardware, the same hardware which Street Fighter III and its derivatives ran on. Despite being quite common in Japan, it was only minimally distributed overseas. To date, Red Earth is the only CPS III game which has never been officially ported to home platforms, although its characters have appeared in later Capcom games, either in cameo appearances or as playable characters.</p>
    <h3 id="Story">Story</h3>
    <p class="Content"><span class="title">Red Earth</span> takes place in 1999 on an altered earth that is stuck in a mythological medieval fantasy state. A new country has risen led by the evil Blade, who sends out various monsters to take over the world. Four heroes emerge to defend earth.
        The western translation has the same premise, but takes place in 13XX and showcases an Earth where no Industrial Revolution nor Renaissance had occurred to progress the world into the modern day.</p>
